GINNA: An atlas of 33 resting-state networks with empirical cognitive labelling

The Groupe d'Imagerie Neurofonctionnelle Network Atlas (GINNA) is a resting-state atlas that comprises 33 resting-state networks (RSNs). 

Each network has been evaluated with respect to its cognitive profile using a meta-analytic decoding strategy that rests on Neurosynth.
Each network is provided with a suggested cognitive label, as determined to faithfully summarize the results of the decoding by 6 independent neuroimaging experts. 

More details are available in the preprint:

paper doi xx

Two versions of the atlas are provided: zstats maps and binary maps. 

As the networks may overlap, the zstat atlas can be used as a probabilistic atlas. see [link] examples.
