# Resting-State Network Atlas: Labeling Initiative

## Overview
Welcome to the community-driven initiative to refine and assess the cognitive labeling of GINNA 33 resting-state networks ! This repository contains an atlas of networks with both **objective labels** derived from meta-analytic terms and **subjective labels** based on expert interpretation and PCA analysis.

## Goals
1. Assess the proposed subjective labels.
2. Propose alternative labels with motivated justifications.
3. Vote on the most appropriate labels based on community consensus.

## How to Contribute
1. **Assess Labels**:
   - Visit the [Issues](../../issues) tab.
   - Comment on existing issues for the network you want to assess.

2. **Propose a New Label**:
   - Use the provided [Label Assignment Template](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=label-assessment.md&title=%5BLABELING%5D+RSNXX+-+LABEL) and open a new issue.

3. **Vote on Labels**:
   - Use GitHub reactions (`üëç`, `üëé`, `üßê`) on comments to vote.
   - In addition to opening new labeling issues, feel free to comment on any existing one!

## Files and Directories (**work in progress**)
- `data/`: Contains the atlas and descriptions.
- `proposed_labels/`: Stores current labels with justifications.
- `submissions/`: Community-submitted label proposals.
- `voting_results/`: Summaries of voting outcomes.
