# Resting-State Network Atlas: Labeling Initiative

## Overview
Welcome to the community-driven initiative to refine and assess the labeling of 33 resting-state networks in the brain! This repository contains an atlas of networks with both **objective labels** derived from meta-analytic terms and **subjective labels** based on expert interpretation and PCA analysis.

## Goals
1. Assess the proposed subjective labels.
2. Propose alternative labels with motivated justifications.
3. Vote on the most appropriate labels based on community consensus.

## How to Contribute
1. **Assess Labels**:
   - Visit the [Issues](../../issues) tab.
   - Comment on existing issues for the network you want to assess.

2. **Propose a New Label**:
   - Use the provided [Proposal Template](#proposal-template) and open a new issue.

3. **Vote on Labels**:
   - Use GitHub reactions (`üëç`, `üëé`, `üßê`) on comments to vote.

## Files and Directories (**work in progress**)
- `data/`: Contains the atlas and descriptions.
- `proposed_labels/`: Stores current labels with justifications.
- `submissions/`: Community-submitted label proposals.
- `voting_results/`: Summaries of voting outcomes.

## Proposal Template
To propose a new label, open an issue and include:
```markdown
**Proposed Label**: [New Label]
**Network ID**: [ID]
**Justification**:
- [Explain why this label is suitable, using evidence where applicable.]

**References**:
- [Cite relevant studies, datasets, or analyses.]
